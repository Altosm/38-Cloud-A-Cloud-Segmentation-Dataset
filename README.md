# 38-Cloud: A Cloud Segmentation Dataset
This dataset includes 38 [Landsat 8](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-8?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con) scene images and their manually extracted pixel-level ground truths for cloud detection.
The entire images of these scenes are cropped into multiple 384*384 patches to be proper for deep learning based semantic segmentation.
